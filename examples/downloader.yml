  description: 'Server downloader API

    <br/> AsyncAPI currently does not support Socket.IO binding and Web Socket like
    syntax used for now.

    In order to add support for Socket.IO ACK value, AsyncAPI is extended with with
    x-ack keyword.

    This documentation should **NOT** be used for generating code due to these limitations.
